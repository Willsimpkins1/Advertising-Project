Here we have the code and data files for our project for EMATM0037: Mathematical and Data Modelling, To run the code on your computer simply download the code files and data sets onto your home computer and run them. You will need to edit the lines for reading and returning the excel sheets to make sure that the code is reading your dataset from whatever file you have saved it to and returns it to the file you want it to. To do this simply edit the file path as stated at the start and end of the code.
